## Workflow

When you have a plan, or set of plans, in the form of shapefiles that you would like to score/grade,
use the chamber-specific aggregation script and the provided shapefile to attach the plan.

Make sure to only plans for one chamber are in the /Plans folder at once.
Follow the instructions in VA_add_new_plan script and run through it cell by cell.
You will want to run through this once per chamber, and may have to do it every
time a new plan is out you want to score. The /archive folder is useful for keeping old maps.

When you finish the VA_add_new_plan.py script, it will output a file called
VA_precs_(chamber)_scoring20.shp where the chamber will be cong, senate, or house.
This is an input for scoring scripts. Once you have
the VA_precs_(chamber)_scoring20.shp file, open up the scoring script that corresponds to the chamber.
Fill in the information in the "# ----- CODE TO CHANGE FOR EACH RUN OF CODE" section.
The district_column_names refers to the column names of your district plans in the shapefile.
Make sure you have a folder on your local computer where the resulting json will be saved in the folder_to_store variable.
Once you have filled out this section, run the file and it
should output jsons for each district plan that you are scoring into your
folder_to_store. You can open up the jsons to see a dictionary of data that you have saved for each plan.

With the json data, you can now compare the metric results to the benchmark thresholds to determine the grades
that the plan would receive for competitiveness, partisan fairness, geography as well as the final grade.
